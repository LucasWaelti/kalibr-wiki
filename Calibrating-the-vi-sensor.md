#Calibrating the VI-Sensor


##Procedure
The calibration procedure consists of the following steps:
    setting the focus
    intrinsic camera calibration
    Camera-IMU calibration (temporal and spatial)
    verification 

Check the following requirements before you start with the calibraion procedure:

    properly installed calibration framework
    good calibration target
    metric IMU data as ROS message stream
    image ROS stream(s)
    IMU error statistics (noise density / random walk)
