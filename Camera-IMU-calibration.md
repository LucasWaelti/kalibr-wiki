The camera-imu calibration tool estimates the spatial and temporal parameters of a camera system with respect to an intrinsically calibrated IMU. Image and IMU data has to be provided in a [ROS](https://www.ros.org) bag. 

The calibration parameters are estimated using a full batch optimization with splines to model the pose of the system. Detailed information about the approach can be found in the following papers: (see [1](#paul1), [2](#paul2))

##How to use it

###1) Requirements
The intrinsic parameters of the IMU (e.g. scales, axis misalignment, nonlinearities,...) need to be calibrated beforehand and and its correction applied to the dataset.

Further an IMU configuration YAML has to be created containing the following statistical properties for the accelerometers and gyroscopes:

* noise density
* bias random walk

Please refer to the [YAML formats](yaml-formats) page for the data format.

###2) Collect images
Create a ROS bag containing the raw image streams either by directly recording from a ROS sensor streams or by using the _[bagcreater](bag-format)_ script on a list of image files and IMU data in a CSV file.

The calibration target is fixed in this calibration and the camera-imu system is moved in front of the target to excite all IMU axis. It is important to have good illumination and to keep the camera shutter times low to avoid motion blur while exciting the IMU.

Good results have been obtained by using a camera rate of 20 Hz and an IMU rate of 200 Hz. 

**Tips:**

* try to excite all IMU axes (rotation and translation)
* avoid shocks 
* keep the motion blur low:
    * low shutter times
    * good illumination 

**WARNING:**
If you are using a calibration target with symmetries (checkerboard, circlegrid), movements which could lead to flips in the target pose estimates have to be avoided. To avoid this problem entirely the use of an [Aprilgrid](calibration-targets) is recommended. 

###3) Running the calibration
The tool must be provided with the following input:

* **--bag filename.bag**<br>
    ROS bag containing the image and IMU data<br>
* **--cam camchain.yaml**<br>
    intrinsic and extrinsic calibration parameters of the camera system. The output of the multiple-camera-calibration tool can be used directly here. (see [YAML formats](yaml-formats))<br>
* **--imu imu.yaml**<br>
    contains the IMU statistics and the IMU's topic (see [YAML formats](yaml-formats))<br>
* **--target target.yaml**<br>
    the calibration target configuration (see [Cailbration targets](#calibration-target))

The calibration can be run using:
> kalibr_calibrate_imu_camera --bag [filename.bag] --cam [camchain.yaml] --imu [imu.yaml] --target [target.yaml]

The temporal calibration is turned off by default and can be enabled using the **--time-calibration** argument. More information about options is available using the help argument:<br\>
> kalibr_calibrate_imu_camera --h


###4) The output
The calibration will produce the following output files:

* **report-imucam-%BAGNAME%.pdf**: Report in PDF format. Contains all plots for documentation.
* **results-imucam-%BAGNAME%.txt**: Result summary as a text file.
* **camchain-imucam-%BAGNAME%.yaml**: Results in YAML format. This file is based on the input ***camchain.yaml*** with added transformations (and time shifts) for all cameras with respect to the imu. Please check the used format [here](yaml-formats).

##An example run using a sample dataset
Download the sample dataset from the [Downloads](downloads) page and extract it. The archive will contain the bag-file, calibration target and imu configuration file.

> kalibr_calibrate_cameras --bag dataset_icc.bag --cam camchain.yaml --imu imu0.yaml --target aprilgrid_6x6.yaml
