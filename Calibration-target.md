#Supported calibration targets


Three different calibration target are supported which are configured using a YAML-file. Please find the configuration details below.

##A) Aprilgrid
With the Aprilgrid partially visible targets can be detected without problems. This greatly simplifies the data collection and makes this grid the recommended target to use with this toolbox.

Aprilgrid PDFs can be downloaded here:

or can be created according to your size requirements using the script here:

The awsome [Apriltag implementation](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/) of M. Kaess is being used for tag extraction in this toolbox. (see [apriltags](#olson))

**aprilgrid.yaml**
```
target_type: 'aprilgrid' #gridtype
tagCols: 6               #number of apriltags
tagRows: 6               #number of apriltags
tagSize: 0.088           #size of apriltag, edge to edge [m]
tagSpacing: 0.3          #ratio of space between tags to tagSize
                         #example: tagSize=2m, spacing=0.5m --> tagSpacing=0.25[-]
```

##B) Checkerboard
The standard checkerboard pattern is supported using the following configuration:

**checkerboard.yaml**
```
target_type: 'checkerboard' #gridtype
targetCols: 6               #number of internal chessboard corners
targetRows: 7               #number of internal chessboard corners
rowSpacingMeters: 0.06      #size of one chessboard square [m]
colSpacingMeters: 0.06      #size of one chessboard square [m]
```

##C) Circlegrid
The standard OpenCV symmetric and asymmetric circle grid are supported using the following configuration:

**circlegrid.yaml**
```
target_type: 'circlegrid'  #gridtype
targetCols: 6              #number of circles (cols)
targetRows: 7              #number of circles (rows)
spacingMeters: 0.02        #distance between circles [m]
asymmetricGrid: False      #use asymmetric grid (opencv) [bool]
```

##Tipps/Problems

    Make sure the printed target is as flat as possible. Best is to glue it to a rigid plate such as aluminum or stable wood.
    Most printers will scale the target during the printing process. Make sure to remeasure the important sizes and use this data during the calibration.
    Reserve a white border around the calibration target.
